> # **OVERVIEW**
Boardgame Bazaar is a dedicated online board game store, where customers can easily navigate to view games organised and presented within a number of categories.  Categories are assigned by admin users or are determined through functions based on the saved product data.  Controls exist to preserve stock levels during purchasing so customers are aware as to what is available and are prevented from buying a product that is out of stock.  This combined with an intuitive interface aims to deliver a smooth and enjoyable customer experience to maximise repeat visits to the site

------

> # **STRATEGY**
The board game industry has seen a resurgence in recent years and it is expected to carry on growing further.  Industry forecasters predict the global board game market will be worth more than Â£9bn by 2023.  For many gamers, the enjoyment of playing board and card games among friends, family members, and fellow enthusiasts is invaluable. And they are willing to pay for the experience, with the majority of gamers (41%) purchasing five to ten new games or expansions a year.

Consequently whilst there are plenty of online board game stores, there is still room in the market for a new store to thrive and succeed.  The goal of this project is to produce an e-commerce store dedicated to the sale of new table top board games.   Whilst other stores offer board games and associated paraphernalia, the focus of boardgame Bazaar will be the sale of the core experience: Games and associated expansions.

> # **SCOPE**

# Content

## The presentation of the site is concerned with:

## Functional Requirements
1. Mobile first; the site is designed to work on mobile and tablet screens first, but responsive design ensures that it scales up and looks good on laptop and desktop screens.
2. Flexible Navbar and site options to reflect a logged in user and admin user to restrict some functionality of the website.
3. A contact function/form that will allow the sending of feedback to an existing email.
4. Clear and obvious links to social media platforms.
5. Feedback animations to provide players with clear interaction cues.
6. Interactive functions for user to rate and review a game, and to view feedback provided by others.

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Contents Table</a></div>

------

> # **STRUCTURE**

The website is broadly separated into three sections:

1. Sections and functions accessible whilst not being logged in:

2. Sections and functions accessible when registered and logged in:

3. Sections and functions accessible when logged in as an admin user:

# Navigation

## Navbar
The Navbar is displayed at all resolutions and is a permanet navigation feature.

### Social Icons
- Social icons link to there respective sites and open the social network site within a new browser tab.  
- Displayed permanently within the foot and in the navbar on desktop screens only.

### Account Buttons
- Conditional display of icons and text to login, register, access account, and logout.  Each navigates to the appropriate page.  
- Displayed in navbar at all resolutions though text is not shown on mobile screens; only the icons.
- Admin functions are available within a user account if the user has admin status.

### Shopping Cart
- The shopping cart can be accessed at any point by clicking on the shopping cart symbol in the top right of navbar which will take the user to the shopping cart page.
- Whilst shopping, a preview of the shopping cart is displayed upon the addition an item to the cart.  This is done via a bootstrap5 Offcanvas component.  From within the Offcanvas the user can select to view the shopping cart page or continue shopping.  The Offcanvas is displayed at all resolutions.

### Navigation Menu
- Navigation menu displaying 'home' icon to navigate the user to the landing pages from any page within the site.  
- Shop Front displays a drop-down menu that displays the available boardgames by 'bestsellers', 'new releases', 'pre-orders' and 'on sale'.  
- Shop by Genre displays a drop-down menu that displays the available boardgames by genres that have been assigned to each game.
- The navigation menu is responsive and so content collapses behind a button on tablet and mobile screens

### Brand Logo
- Clicking or tapping the brand navigates the user to the landing pages from any page within the site. 
- The logo is displayed at all resolutions.

### Search Bar
- The search bar will return any boardgames that contain the user input search parameter in the product title or description.
- Displayed as a bar at desktop resolutions and as a button at tablet and mobile resolutions.  Button is tapped to display a search bar.

## Products

### Product Display
- Clicking or tapping on the product image navigates the user to the product detail page for that product

### Product Detail page
- Genre tags are displayed below the product price which allows the user to see other board games within the same genres assigned to the product they are viewing.
- Keep shopping button takes the user to the home page.

## Product attributes:
### New Releases.
Determined during site startup and when ânew releasesâ selected from the shop front menu through the function âdetermine_new_releases()â In home app views.py.   

#### Mechanism:
Function checks the recorded release date mandatory field against the date 90 days in the past from the current date.  If the release of the game occurred within the past 90 days then it is checked as being a ânew releaseâ.

#### Display:
Only games that were released within the last 90 days will be checked as a new release and therefore displayed as such on the website with a banner over the image.

### Pre-orders.
Determined during site startup and when âpre-ordersâ selected from the shop front menu through the function âdetermine_preorders()â In home app views.py.   

#### Mechanism: 
function checks the recorded release date mandatory field against the current date.  If the release date of the game is in the future then it is checked as being a âpre-orderâ.

#### Display:
Only games that have a release date recorded in the database that is in the future will be checked as a preorder and therefore displayed as such on the website with a banner over the image.


### Stock.
The stock figure is updated when an item is purchased to reflect the amount purchased.  There are no controls to stop the 'stock' count becoming a minus figure as this should be allowed to highlight if more stock has been sold than is in place.  However there are a number of measures in place to prevent this from happening.

1. To keep the customer informed, the current stock is displayed to the customer along with the product, both on the home page and on the product detail.  If there is over 10 in stock stock then '10+ in stock' is displayed.  If stock is 10 or below, then the actual figure is displayed to the customer as 'X in stock.  If there is no stock then, 'in stock soon' is displayed on the home screen and 'Sorry, currently out of sttock' is displayed within the product detail.  Additionally; to stop the sale of products with no stock, the quantity selector and 'add to cart' button are not displayed.

2. The stock figure is also used to limit the amount a customer can buy at once by affecting the maximum number that can be selected.  If the product stock is more than 9 then the most of any product a customer can buy at once is 10.  However should the current stock fall below 10 then then limit on the quantity selector is set by the current stock number. 

3. At the point of purchase when the customer clicks/taps on the 'complete order' button on the checkout screen, a realtime check is made against the current stock level of each product in the basket and the intended purchase amount. If any of the items purchased quantity is more than the stock figure for that item, the purchase fails and the customer is directed back back to the cart screen.  A message is also displayed explaining this and asks for the customer to recheck the displayed stock levels for their purchase(s).  This is to catch instances where a customer has been able to add items to their cart, but may be slow to checkout and remaining stock has been sold in the meantime.

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Contents Table</a></div>

------

> # **FURTHER DEVELOPMENT**
* The price per item is not shown on the order details; only the order totals are shown, the item(s) bought and quantity of each.  The bought price per item cannot be shown as this is not saved.  Further development will look to save and therefore show the bought price of an item so as to provide more details on each entry within the customer orders history. 

------

> # **DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT**

A repository was setup in GitHub using the Code Institute Gitpod [full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).  Development was completed using Gitpod and code was regularly pushed back to the GitHub repository.  The master branch of this repository is the most current version and has been used for the deployed version of the site.

You will need to install the following into your chosen development environment to run this project:

*	[Python 3 - core code](https://www.python.org/)
*	[PIP - package installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
*	[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

The current live website is hosted as a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) app, however the images and static files are hosted on an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) simple storage service (s3).  [Stripe](https://stripe.com) is utilised for the management of financial transactions and [Gmail](https://google.com) is used for emails.  The instructions in this section cover the process to set up and use these services. 

# Running the project locally
To work on the project code locally a clone can be taken by following the steps below or downloading the files as a zip file. To see the options, open the desired repository and select the drop down menu button âCodeâ (found under the repo name and above the list of files).

## Clone:
To do this you will need Git for Windows installed (for other OS versions see [here]( https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

*   Open Git.
*   Change the current working directory is required. On windows, by default, the files will be downloaded to the users file directory on the C: drive.
*   In the âCodeâ dropdown menu in GitHub, select either HTTPS or SSH and copy the link.
*   In the GitBash window type âgit cloneâ and then paste the copied link:
```
  git clone https://github.com/C-Undritz/Boardgame-Bazaar.git
```
*   Hit Enter and the files will then be cloned to be worked on locally.

Please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for the GitHub Docs page on this process.

Within your development environment, if needed, upgrade pip locally with the command:
```
  pip install --upgrade pip
```
The cloned repository includes the ârequirements.txtâ to enable the installation of the packages required for this project using the following command in the terminal:
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Once that is successfully complete, setup a super user to log into django admin and have admin privileges throughout the site, by typing the below into the terminal and following the prompts:
```
  python 3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
## Environment Variables
The following environment variables (in CAPS) must be set within your development environment for the site to function correctly.  These are listed and described below and instructions to obtain these are featured in the following sections.

* DEVELOPMENT
  * Required so that within the development environment, debug = True.
  * *Value: set as **True*** 
* SECRET_KEY
  * Required by Django: A random sequence of characters used to maintain security.  
  * *Value: Django secret key.  A good resource is [miniwebtool â django secret key  generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) and should be different to the same variable in the Heroku app.*
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY 
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET
  * *Value: from stripe webhook endpoint (see below section [Create webhook](#Create-new-webhook-end-point)).*  Note that this is different to the one set for Heroku (see below section ?).  

Database migrations will need to be made by following the below commands:
```
  python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run*

  python3 manage.py makemigrations

  python3 manage.py migrate --plan*

  python3 manage.py migrate
```
*These commands do not have to be run, but it is bext practice, so that the plan migrations can be viewed before completing them.

The project repository comes with a âdb.jsonâ file containing all data added during development which can be used to deploy by running this command within the terminal:  
```
  python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
```

The project should then be push to your repository using the below commands:
```
  git add <name of file> or <.>

  git commit -m *<commit message>*

  git push
```

The application can now be run locally by typing in a terminal window:
```
  python3 manage.py runserver
```

# Heroku Deployment

## Heroku Variables
The following environment variables (in CAPS) must be set within the âConfig Varsâ section in Heroku for the deployed site to function correctly.   The config variables are added within the Heroku app by selecting the Settings tab, and under the heading 'Config Vars' clicking the button 'Reveal Config Vars' to show the key / value input boxes for the variables.  Instructions to obtain the variables are featured within below sections.

* SECRET_KEY
  * Required by Django: A random sequence of characters used to maintain security.  
  * *Value: Can use django secret key generator (https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) and should be different to the same variable in the development environment.*
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY 
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET
  * *Value: from stripe webhook endpoint. Note that this is different to the one set for the development environment (see below section [Create webhook](#Create-new-webhook-end-point)).*  
* DATABASE_URL
  * *Value: automatically setup during Heroku deployment (can be obtained by viewing your Postgres database within the Heroku dashboard, under Settings Database Credentials).*
* USE_AWS
  * Required so that the deployed app uses AWS for images and static files.
  * *Value: set as **True***
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  * Required for connection to the AWS s3 bucket
  * *Value: obtained within the downloaded .csv file generated during user creation in AWS (see below section [Create s3 bucket](#Create-s3-bucket)).*
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  * Required for connection to the AWS s3 bucket
  * *Value: obtained within the downloaded .csv file generated during user creation in AWS (see below section [Create s3 bucket](#Create-s3-bucket)).*
* EMAIL_HOST_PASS
  * Required by Django to send emails using chosen email account
  * *Value: 16 character password provided by, in this instance; Gmail (see below section [Email Setup](#Email-Setup)).*
* EMAIL_HOST_USER
  * Required by Django to send emails using chosen email account
  * *Value: the email address of chosen email account (e.g. `bob.smith@gmail.com`)*

## Deployment
In order to run properly, Heroku requires:
*	requirements.txt
*	Procfile

Both of these files should be within the cloned repository, so ensure these are pushed to your GitHub repository. 

To deploy the app to Heroku from the GitHub repository you will need to follow the below steps:
*	Go to [Heroku]( https://www.heroku.com/).
*	Log in and click on 'New' > 'create new app'.
*	Enter an App name (do not use spaces and use lower case letters).
*	Choose a region, then click âcreate appâ.
* Within the new app select the âresourcesâ tab and under addons type in âpostgresâ to provision a new Heroku Postgres database (this will also add the required DATABASE_URL variable and value in the Heroku Config variables)

### Setup to auto-deploy when pushed to GitHub:
* Within the Heroku web dashboard, Click on the Deploy tab:  
![Heroku option deploy](assets/readme/heroku_options_deploy.png)
* Select deployment method as âGitHubâ, and then search for your repository below that.
* Once your repository name is returned, click 'connect'.
* Then click âenable automatic deploysâ

Within the development environment, in a terminal window, login into heroku by entering the below command and following the prompts.
```
  heroku login -i
```

Then type the below to setup a superuser: 
```
  heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Database migrations will need to be made to the Heroku postgres by following the below commands (you will need to be logged into Heroku to perform these):
```
  heroku run python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run*

  heroku run python manage.py makemigrations

  heroku run python manage.py migrate --plan*

  heroku run python manage.py migrate
```
*These commands do not have to be run, but it is bext practice, so that the plan migrations can be viewed before completing them.

Once all the configuration variables have been added, the deployed app can then be run from Heroku by selecting it and clicking 'open app'.

## Connect Django to AWS s3 bucket.
Within the Django app settings python file enter the name and region name for the AWS s3 bucket that you have set up as indicated below:  
![AWS bucket - aws django settings](assets/readme/django_settings_aws.png)

Within Heroku add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to the config variables and also add a USE_AWS key and set it to true.  The access key and secret key are contained with the **downloaded csv file**.

Once that is done, git add, commit and push the changes which will trigger a deployment to Heroku.  Check the Heroku build log to check that the static files were collected and there should be a 'static' folder within the s3 bucket. 

## Add media files to s3 bucket
The below instructions detail how to do this within the s3 management interface.

* Within the s3 bucket overview click create folder and call it media.
* Inside that folder click on âuploadâ and then âadd filesâ
* Select all of the product images (found within the repo download performed earlier) and click open
* Click next and then under permissions, check the box for âgrant public-read accessâ:  
![AWS bucket - add media](assets/readme/aws_bucket_add_media.png)
* Then click upload.
* There should now be a 'media' folder within the s3 bucket containing the images. 

# Stripe Setup
* Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account or log in to existing.
* On the Stripe dashboard, under âDevelopersâ copy the âtest API keyâ and â Secret keyâ.  Use these as the values for the environment and Heroku variables STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as detailed above. 

## Create new webhook end point.
**NOTE:** Two separate webhooks will need to be setup. One for the development environment and one for the Heroku app.
* Run the application to get the address of the site.  Copy this and go to the Stripe dashboard.
* Click âDevelopersâ, select âwebhooksâ and then click âAdd endpointâ.
* Paste in the site URL and add to the end â/checkout/wh/â:  
![Stripe webhook url entry](assets/readme/stripe_wh_url.png)
* Click âSelect Eventsâ and select the events to listen to as:
```
  âpayment_intent_suceededâ 

  âpayment_intent_failedâ
```
* In the newly created webhook endpoint details the âsigning secretâ is now available.  Copy this and add it to the value for the environment and Heroku variable STRIPE_WH_SECRET as detailed above.
* Within the Stripe dashboard for that webhook, click âsend test webhookâ and verify that it is working.

The STRIPE_CURRENCY variable is defined within the django app 'settings' python file and is set to âgbpâ.  If a different currency is needed then this will need to be changed.  See this link for [supported currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#presentment-currencies)

# Email Setup
The below instructions cover the setup using a [Gmail](https://google.com) account.

* Log in to your email account or set one up.
* Click account settings, and select the 'Accounts and Import' option from the top selection
* Under âChange account settingsâ click âOther Google Account settingsâ
* Click on the âsecurityâ option on the left and then under âSigning in to Googleâ click on â2-Step Verificationâ
* Click âget startedâ, enter password and then work through the verification.
* Once verification is done and 2-Step verification is turned on, a new option now shows under the previous âSigning in to Googleâ menu screen.
* In this, on the App passwords screen, select from the dropdowns; âmailâ for app and âotherâ for device.  Add an appropriate name and click âgenerateâ.
You will then be given a 16 character password which you will need to copy.

## In Heroku.
Within the Heroku Config variables add the 16 character password as the value to the variable âEMAIL_HOST_PASSâ.  Add another variable called âEMAIL_HOST_USERâ and set the value as the gmail account email used.

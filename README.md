> # **OVERVIEW**

The board game industry has seen a resurgence in recent years and it is expected to carry on growing further.  Industry forecasters predict the global board game market will be worth more than Â£9bn by 2023.

For many gamers, the enjoyment of playing board and card games among friends, family members, and fellow enthusiasts is invaluable. And they are willing to pay for the experience, with the majority of gamers (41%) purchasing five to ten new games or expansions a year.

Consequently recent survey data found that 43% of of board gamers may typically have between 26 to 100+ games and so, often, space becomes an issue.  This has led to a large scene for selling on games that are no longer played enough or just did not click with a gamer or gaming group.  You can now find popular and relatively recent releases available on ebay and there is a 2nd hand games facility available on boardgamegeek and many facebook groups where gamers can sell or trade games.

------

> # **STRATEGY**

Research has revealed that there is no current dedicated online board game store that will allow users to sell games in exchange for store credit.  Boardgame Bazaar uniquely offers this facility to registered site users and manages the end to end sale process through the users account and admin interface.  This allows users to build up credit to spend in store and will also provide Boardgame Bazaar with quality 2nd hand stock to sell longside new stock of the latest games and well known titles.

The goal of this project is to produce a MVP of an e-commerce store dedicated to the sale of new and second hand table top board games.

> # **OVERVIEW**
Boardgame Bazaar is a dedicated online board game store, where customers can easily navigate to view games organised and presented within a number of categories and genres.  Genres and categories are assigned by admin users or are determined through functions based on the saved product data.  Controls exist to preserve stock levels during purchasing so customers are aware as to what is available and are prevented from buying a product that is out of stock.  This combined with an intuitive interface aims to deliver a smooth and enjoyable customer experience to maximise repeat visits to the site

> # **STRATEGY**
The board game industry has seen resurgence in recent years and it is expected to carry on growing further.  Industry forecasters predict the global board game market will be worth more than Â£9bn by 2023.  For many gamers, the enjoyment of playing board and card games among friends, family members, and fellow enthusiasts is invaluable and they are willing to pay for the experience, with the majority of gamers (41%) purchasing five to ten new games or expansions a year.

Consequently whilst there are plenty of online board game stores, there is still room in the market for a new store to thrive and succeed.  The goal of this project is to produce an e-commerce store dedicated to the sale of new table top board games.   Whilst other stores offer board games and associated paraphernalia, the focus of boardgame Bazaar will be the sale of the core experience: Games and associated expansions.

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Contents Table</a></div>

# Database Schema
A relational database has been used to deliver the expected functionality.  SQLite was used in the development of the site and Postgres provided by the Heroku platform was used in production.  The diagram below shows the database models and relationships between each.

![database_schema](assets/readme/boardgame_bazaar-database_design.png)

## Models

### Product
* Contains all of the information needed to directly display information about the product.
* Value for the name field is saved as a lowercase value so duplicate checking can be performed against this field.
* Many to many relationship to the Genre model allows many Genres to be assigned to a product.
* Boolean value 'on_sale' manually selected by admin for the product to be displayed as 'on sale' and display the sale price.
* Stock and sold values updated by a post save signal from the checkout app OrderLineItem model
* pre_order and new_release Boolean values are updated by a CustomManager function called each time the products database queried.  The 'def determine_new_or_preorder' function within the custom manager runs queries against the release date value of the products and the current date to determine the true/false status of these.
* rating is a rounded average value of all reviews submitted against the product.  it is updated by a post save and post delete signal from the products app Review model.

### Genre
* An attribute of the product model only and displayed with product information
* Many to many relationship to the Product model allows many Products to be assigned to a Genre.
* name field offers a more 'code friendly' version of the name value.  Admin is guided to provide this value without spaces (using underscores).  This is however, not enforced or checked.
* friendly_name is the value used to display the genre name within the site.
* Values for both fields saved as lowercase values so duplicate checking can be performed, though duplicate checking only currently performed on the friendly name field
* A through table (GenreAssignent) implemented for the product genre assignment so that this could be viewed, edited and controlled via the admin interface if required.

### Review
* Links together a review with the user and product which is then used to check if the user has already reviewed a product.  This determines whether a blank form is returned when selecting review or whether the form is displayed with the existing user review for the product in question.
* review holds review text of a maximum of 500 characters.  
* rating is a whole number value between 1 and 5.

### User
* Generated automatically by Django when a customer registers an account.
* username and email are mandatory fields and value taken during registration
* first_name and last_name are not mandatory fields, but are required during checkout.

### UserProfile
* Contains contact and address details for the user.
* Not mandatory fields but are required during checkout for the delivery and contact information to facilitate delivery of a product.
* Many to many relationship to the Product model to facilitate the wishlist functionality governed through the 'profiles_userprofile_wishlist' auto generated model.
* A defined wishlist through table was not implemented and Django was left to control this as this would be customer personal data and so the relationships should not be viewed by any admin users.

### MailingList
* Not linked to any other model as this can contain the email (and dated added) of any customer that visits the site; they do not have to be registered.
* Checks against the saved email value in the User model are performed to determine if the User email value is within the MailingList database to provide mailing list status within the account information page.
* An alternative implementation of the same functionality could have required a Boolean value within the UserProfile model to check for mailing status.  However as the MailingList model can hold email addresses of none registered users, such an approach would offer little benefit over the implemented solution.

### Order
* Stores all information relating to the order including the products and quantity bought (stored with the OrderLineItem model), associated user profile, delivery details and order totals.
* Works out the total through the update_total method and automatically applies the discount depending on quantity bought at the point of purchase.

### OrderLineItem 
* Contains the information of each product and quantity of that product associated with each Order.

> # **TESTING**

Unfortuanately time did not allow for any thorough automated testing.  Writing automated tests using Django's unit tests will form part of the intended future work for this project and be completed before any futher development on the site is started.

Testing completed is detailed in the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/C-Undritz/Boardgame-Bazaar/blob/main/TESTING.md) document

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Contents Table</a></div>

> # **FEATURES**

# Responsive 
The site has been built using the powerful mobile-first flexbox based Bootstrap grid system and display property to ensure that the site looks good and responds well across multiple device sizes.

# Security
Validation queries against the database have been utilised through the site backend functions to ensure that site features restricted to registered users and admin are only reachable through the site interface behind a login page, and not able to be reached via manipulation of the url.  This includes but not limited to:
* Login check for all functions that require a login
* Once logged in only the logged in user's profile is retrieved and at all instances checking the requested records user profile matches the requesting user profile
* Confirming for admin functions that the requesting user is a super user.

# Stripe Webhooks
Stripe payments have been used to securely accept the payments through the store.  This has included the use of stripe webhooks during the purchase process to ensure that an order is created within the database and a confirmation email is sent even if there are issues with database communication at the time of purchase.

# Automatic Discount
As advertised on the banner below the navbar, there is a discount of 3% if three to four products are purchased and 5% if five or more are purchased.  This is applied automatically during shopping by the cart app `contexts.py` cart_contents function.  The returned variables are used to apply the discount and display a message to the customer informing them of how much more is required to purchase to get the discount, to encourage further purchases.

The same discount in then applied and recorded against the order in the database by the update_total method on the Order model.

# Mailing List
At the bottom of the landing/home page there is the opportunity to all customers to subscribe to the newsletter by adding their email to the mailing list.  There are a number of controls in place to maintain the integrity of this database.
* The same email address cannot be entered twice; a check for the existence of the entered email is completed and a message returned to the user if it already exists.
* For registered users the subscription status is displayed at the top of the account information screen and the user is able to subscribe/un-subscribe at the tap of a button.
* If a customer is already subscribed to the newsletter and subsequently creates a new account with the same email, a check will be done to determine if that email is in the mailing list database and automatically display subscribed if it is.
* If a registered user updates their email address within the account information page whilst subscribed, the mailing list record of the customer email is automatically updated to the new email address and the subscribed status remains in place

# Reviews and Ratings
Reviews of a product are only allowed against a verified purchase of the product.  Access to the review page for each product is through the order details for a purchase where the review button is displayed alongside each bought product.  

The customer can leaving a rating by interacting with the star array to give a score out of five and then leave a written review of maximum of 500 characters.  The rating will then be displayed alongside the product image in both the all products pages and product detail pages.

A review and rating can be edited by simply clicking on the same product review button used to add the review.  The existing review will then show and the customer will be able to edit it or delete it from here.

Individual reviews and ratings are displayed below the product with up to three displaying by default and any more available by clicking on a see more reviews link that displays.

# Wishlist
Any product can be added to the customers wishlist by selecting the heart icon in top right of the product details page.  The heart icon will change colour to display wishlist status of the product for the logged in user.  The product can be removed from the wishlist by again tapping on the heart icon.

The wishlist can be viewed from the account pages, where displayed products can be removed from it by selecting the remove button displayed next to the product image and name. 

# Product Data Management and Use
## Product fields:
The Product model fields are updated and used in a number of ways to convey product information to the customer based on their value.  These are detailed below.

### New Releases and Pre-orders
Whether a product is to be considered a 'new-release' or 'pre order' is determined automatically and recorded as a Boolean value for each against the product.  This is performed within the products models CustomManager class which completes two checks using the current date and the release date recorded against the product.

* New release: checks the recorded release date mandatory field against the date 90 days in the past from the current date.  If the release of the game occurred within the past 90 days then it is set as a ânew releaseâ.
* Pre-order: checks the recorded release date mandatory field against the current date.  If the release date of the game is in the future then it is set as a âpre-orderâ.

The result of this is that products will display with a flash over the product image advertising a game as pre-order or new release if either of these are true.

These functions were previously run within the home `view.py` file, however this approached had issues and did not run as expected.  Moving them to a custom manager solved these and is suitable for this project with no discernible impact on performance with the small number of products stored within the database.  However such a function would need to setup as a cron job for serious commercial use of the site and/or a significant increase in the amount of products stored on the database.

### Stock.
The stock value is updated and reduced when an item is purchased to reflect the amount purchased.  There are no controls to stop the 'stock' count becoming a minus figure as this should be allowed to highlight if more stock has been sold than is in place.  However there are a number of measures in place to prevent this from happening.

1. To keep the customer informed, the current stock is displayed to the customer along with the product, both on the home page and on the product detail.  If there is over 10 in stock then '10+ in stock' is displayed.  If stock is 10 or below, then the actual figure is displayed to the customer as 'X in stock.  If there is no stock then, 'in stock soon' is displayed on the home screen and 'Sorry, currently out of stock' is displayed within the product detail.  Additionally; to stop the sale of products with no stock, the quantity selector and 'add to cart' button are not displayed.

2. The stock figure is also used to limit the amount a customer can buy at once by affecting the maximum number that can be selected using the mobile friend increase and decrease buttons.  If the product stock is more than 9 then the most of any product a customer can buy at once is 10.  However should the current stock fall below 10 then then limit on the quantity selector is set by the current stock number. 

3. At the point of purchase when the customer clicks/taps on the 'complete order' button on the checkout screen, a real-time check is made against the current stock level of each product in the basket and the intended purchase amount. If any of the items purchased quantity is more than the stock figure for that item, the purchase fails and the customer is directed back to the cart screen.  A message is also displayed explaining this and asks for the customer to recheck the displayed stock levels for their purchase(s).  This is to catch instances where a customer has been able to add items to their cart, but may be slow to checkout and remaining stock has been sold in the meantime.

The stock figure is adjusted to reflect the receipt of more stock through the admin functions update stock, add product or edit product.

### Sold
Like the stock value, sold value is updated when an item is purchased to reflect the amount purchased.  This figure is not adjusted at any point and is used to display the best seller's product view.

### On_sale
If on_sale is checked then the price value will display as struck-out and light grey.  The sale price will then display in bold.  This is managed within the add product and edit product form.

### Rating
The rating which is an average of all customer ratings of product which is automatically updated whenever a review is submitted.  It is used to display the average rating of a product as filled and empty stars displayed alongside the product.

## Adding, Editing and Deleting Product and Genre Records
### Product records
Adding, editing and Deleting products is completed through the admin functions that are available and display within the account menu only to signed in users that have superuser status.  Editing and deleting a product are also displayed as options within the admin functions on the product detail which are displayed only if a superuser is logged in.

Any added/edited product immediately features in the display of products with the details provided as detailed above determining how it is displayed and with what details.  A duplicate check is performed on the product name field when adding or editing a product.

Any deleted product will immediately be removed from the store and any reviews associated with it also deleted.

### Genre records 
Adding, editing and Deleting genres is completed through the admin functions that are available and display within the account menu only to signed in users that have superuser status.  Any added/edited genre immediately features in the 'shop by genre' drop down navbar menu and within the add/edit product form.  In the same way, any deleted genre will not feature.

A duplicate check is performed on the friendly name field when adding or editing a genre.

> # **FURTHER DEVELOPMENT**
* It was originally planned to implement a feature that would allow the customers to sell their games to the store in exchange for store credit.  This functionality would be enabled through the customer account menu where the customer would select to sell an item, fill in a form and upload pictures.  This would then start a process of exchange between the customer and the business facilitated by the account and admin interfaces. For the business used stock would then be available to buy on the website. This feature was not implemented due to time constraints, but is a planned feature for a future release.  

* Currently a customer is prevented from buying too much of one item with a default ceiling value of 10 which reduces to match the stock of an item if it goes below 10.  There is also a final check at the point of purchase.  Whilst there is the control on the quantity selector, a check will need to be added to the add_to_cart function to see if the quantity of an item already in the cart is already the maximum allowed value. This is a planned feature for a future release.

* A 'goBack' navigation button was added at the top of the product detail page to aid navigation due to the amount ways that this screen can be navigated to.   Also because of this the 'window.history.back()' method was used.  This generally works well, however if the user interacts with any features on the product detail page (add to favourites, reviews) then the go back button needs to be clicked more than once to get back to the desired page.  Further development will need to be completed to improve this.

* The price per item is not shown on the order details; only the order totals are shown, the item(s) bought and quantity of each.  The bought price per item cannot be shown as this is not saved.  Further development will look to save and therefore show the bought price of an item so as to provide more details on each entry within the customer orders history.

* The site allows a registered customer to save only one address, with the option to add and save others not currently a feature.  Further development will look into allowing users to add and save multiple addresses and mark one as primary that will show up as default when checking out.

* Look into implementing pagination for the all product views.  This was immplemented, but issues occurred once the drop down sort selector was added (see remaining issue 7 in TESTING.md)

* There is currently no facility for customers to login via social media accounts.  This will be implemented in the future.

* Currently there is only one way to checkout; with a card.  A planned implementation for the future will be to integrate digital wallets like Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

* Investigation and work will take place to improve the performance score returned for the site across all browsers.

> # **DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT**

A repository was setup in GitHub using the Code Institute Gitpod [full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).  Development was completed using Gitpod and code was regularly pushed back to the GitHub repository.  The master branch of this repository is the most current version and has been used for the deployed version of the site.

You will need to install the following into your chosen development environment to run this project:

*	[Python 3 - core code](https://www.python.org/)
*	[PIP - package installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
*	[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

The current live website is hosted as a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) app, however the images and static files are hosted on an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) simple storage service (s3).  [Stripe](https://stripe.com) is utilised for the management of financial transactions and [Gmail](https://google.com) is used for emails.  The instructions in this section cover the process to set up and use these services. 

# Running the project locally
To work on the project code locally a clone can be taken by following the steps below or downloading the files as a zip file. To see the options, open the desired repository and select the drop down menu button âCodeâ (found under the repo name and above the list of files).

## Clone:
To do this you will need Git for Windows installed (for other OS versions see [here]( https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

*   Open Git.
*   Change the current working directory is required. On windows, by default, the files will be downloaded to the users file directory on the C: drive.
*   In the âCodeâ dropdown menu in GitHub, select either HTTPS or SSH and copy the link.
*   In the GitBash window type âgit cloneâ and then paste the copied link:
```
  git clone https://github.com/C-Undritz/Boardgame-Bazaar.git
```
*   Hit Enter and the files will then be cloned to be worked on locally.

Please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for the GitHub Docs page on this process.

Within your development environment, if needed, upgrade pip locally with the command:
```
  pip install --upgrade pip
```
The cloned repository includes the ârequirements.txtâ to enable the installation of the packages required for this project using the following command in the terminal:
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Once that is successfully complete, setup a super user to log into Django admin and have admin privileges throughout the site, by typing the below into the terminal and following the prompts:
```
  python 3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
## Environment Variables
The following environment variables (in CAPS) must be set within your development environment for the site to function correctly.  These are listed and described below and instructions to obtain these are featured in the following sections.

* DEVELOPMENT
  * Required so that within the development environment, debug = True.
  * *Value: set as **True*** 
* SECRET_KEY
  * Required by Django: A random sequence of characters used to maintain security.  
  * *Value: Django secret key.  A good resource is [miniwebtool â django secret key  generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) and should be different to the same variable in the Heroku app.*
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY 
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET
  * *Value: from stripe webhook endpoint (see below section [Create webhook](#Create-new-webhook-end-point)).*  Note that this is different to the one set for Heroku (see below section ?).  

Database migrations will need to be made by following the below commands:
```
  python3 manage.py migrate --plan*

  python3 manage.py migrate
```
The 'makemigrations' command will not need to be run here before the 'migrate' command as all the migration files are within the repository.  Should further changes to the models be made however the below commands will need to be run prior to running migrate:
```
  python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run*

  python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
*These commands do not have to be run, but it is best practice, so that the plan migrations can be viewed before completing them.



The project should then be push to your repository using the below commands:
```
  git add <name of file> or <.>

  git commit -m *<commit message>*

  git push
```

The application can now be run locally by typing in a terminal window:
```
  python3 manage.py runserver
```
Data can then be added to the site when signed in with the superuser credentials.

# Heroku Deployment

## Heroku Variables
The following environment variables (in CAPS) must be set within the âConfig Varsâ section in Heroku for the deployed site to function correctly.   The config variables are added within the Heroku app by selecting the Settings tab, and under the heading 'Config Vars' clicking the button 'Reveal Config Vars' to show the key / value input boxes for the variables.  Instructions to obtain the variables are featured within below sections.

* SECRET_KEY
  * Required by Django: A random sequence of characters used to maintain security.  
  * *Value: Can use Django secret key generator (https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) and should be different to the same variable in the development environment.*
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY 
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  * *Value: from stripe account (see below section [Stripe Setup](#Stripe-Setup))*
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET
  * *Value: from stripe webhook endpoint. Note that this is different to the one set for the development environment (see below section [Create webhook](#Create-new-webhook-end-point)).*  
* DATABASE_URL
  * *Value: automatically setup during Heroku deployment (can be obtained by viewing your Postgres database within the Heroku dashboard, under Settings Database Credentials).*
* USE_AWS
  * Required so that the deployed app uses AWS for images and static files.
  * *Value: set as **True***
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  * Required for connection to the AWS s3 bucket
  * *Value: obtained within the downloaded .csv file generated during user creation in AWS (see below section [Create s3 bucket](#Create-s3-bucket)).*
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  * Required for connection to the AWS s3 bucket
  * *Value: obtained within the downloaded .csv file generated during user creation in AWS (see below section [Create s3 bucket](#Create-s3-bucket)).*
* EMAIL_HOST_PASS
  * Required by Django to send emails using chosen email account
  * *Value: 16 character password provided by, in this instance; Gmail (see below section [Email Setup](#Email-Setup)).*
* EMAIL_HOST_USER
  * Required by Django to send emails using chosen email account
  * *Value: the email address of chosen email account (e.g. `bob.smith@gmail.com`)*

## Deployment
In order to run properly, Heroku requires:
*	requirements.txt
*	Procfile

Both of these files should be within the cloned repository, so ensure these are pushed to your GitHub repository. 

To deploy the app to Heroku from the GitHub repository you will need to follow the below steps:
*	Go to [Heroku]( https://www.heroku.com/).
*	Log in and click on 'New' > 'create new app'.
*	Enter an App name (do not use spaces and use lower case letters).
*	Choose a region, then click âcreate appâ.
* Within the new app select the âresourcesâ tab and under addons type in âpostgresâ to provision a new Heroku Postgres database (this will also add the required DATABASE_URL variable and value in the Heroku Config variables)

### Setup to auto-deploy when pushed to GitHub:
* Within the Heroku web dashboard, Click on the Deploy tab:  
![Heroku option deploy](assets/readme/heroku_options_deploy.png)
* Select deployment method as âGitHubâ, and then search for your repository below that.
* Once your repository name is returned, click 'connect'.
* Then click âenable automatic deploysâ

Within the development environment, in a terminal window, login into Heroku by entering the below command and following the prompts.
```
  heroku login -i
```

Then type the below to setup a superuser: 
```
  heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Database migrations will need to be made to the Heroku postgres by following the below commands (you will need to be logged into Heroku to perform these):
```
  heroku run python manage.py migrate --plan*

  heroku run python manage.py migrate
```
*This command does not have to be run, but it is best practice, so that the planned migrations can be viewed before completing them.

Once all the configuration variables have been added, the deployed app can then be run from Heroku by selecting it and clicking 'open app'. 

# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Setup
## Create s3 bucket
* Go to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and set up an account if you do not have one.
* Once logged in, under âmy accountâ select âAWS Management Consoleâ and search for the service âs3â
* Once in the s3 interface create a new bucket for this project:  
![AWS create bucket button](assets/readme/aws_create_bucket_btn.png)
* Name the bucket and select a region closest to you.
* Uncheck block all public access and acknowledge that the bucket will be public:  
![AWS bucket - block public access settings](assets/readme/aws_create_bucket_public_access.png)
* Select âcreate bucketâ to finish and the bucket will be created.
* Under the bucket properties tab, select to âeditâ Static website hosting and select âenableâ.
* Ensure that âhost a static websiteâ is selected and enter a default value for index as this will not be used for this project deployment:

* Click save.
* Next click permissions tab and select to edit the CORS 
* Enter and save the below cors configuration which will set up the required access between the Heroku app and this s3 bucket.
```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]

```
* Next select to edit the bucket policy and select âpolicy generatorâ to generate a policy.  Before you do that, copy the âBucket ARNâ as shown below (you will also need this for setting up a group within Identity and Access Management below).  
![AWS bucket - edit policy](assets/readme/aws_create_bucket_edit_policy.png)
* Within the policy generator select policy type of âS3 Bucket Policyâ
* Within Add Statements, select âallowâ for effect and type a star within âPrincipalâ:  
![AWS bucket - add statements](assets/readme/aws_create_bucket_add_statements.png)
* For Actions select only âGetObjectâ:  
![AWS bucket - action select](assets/readme/aws_create_bucket_getobject.png)
* Then below that paste in the âbucket ARN into the Amazon Resource Name input box.
* Click âAdd Statementâ, then âGenerate Policyâ
* Copy the policy into the bucket policy editor and then so as to allow access to all resources in this bucket, add a slash star onto the end of the resource key:
* Click Save.
* Next select to edit the Access control list and set the list objects permission for everyone under the Public Access section as below:  
![AWS bucket - acl](assets/readme/aws_create_bucket_acl.png)
 
## Create access policy, group and user
### Create Group and Policy
* Within the AWS services menu open Iam (Identity and Access Management) and in the left hand menu click âUser groupsâ to create a new group.
* Name a new group and click âcreate groupâ.
* Click âpoliciesâ so as to create a policy used to access the new bucket.
* Click âcreate policyâ and then select the âJSONâ tab and select âimport managed policyâ.
* Within the search input, search for s3 and then select to import the Amazon s3 full access policy:  
![AWS bucket - group policy](assets/readme/aws_group_policy.png)
* Modify the policy by entering the ARN from the bucket policy in s3 as the value for resource as below:  
![AWS bucket - policy modification](assets/readme/aws_modify_policy.png)
* Click âNext: Tagsâ and then click âNext: Reviewâ
* Provide a name and description for the policy and click âCreate policyâ.

### Attach policy to group.
* Within the AWS services menu open Iam and in the left hand menu click âUser groupsâ to view the newly created group.
* Select the new group and click on the permissions tab
* Click the âAdd permissionsâ button and select âAttach Policiesâ from the drop down.
* Select the policy that was just created, by checking the tick box and click on âAdd permissionsâ

### Create User and add to group.
* Within the AWS services menu open Iam and in the left hand menu click âUsersâ and then select âAdd usersâ
* Provide a name for the user, check the tick box to grant the user access and select next.
* Check the tick box next to the group just created to add the user to the group.  Click through the next few pages to create user.
* **!IMPORTANT:** On the success page, click 'Download .csv file' which contains the user access key and secret access key needed to authenticate them from the Django app.

## Connect Django to AWS s3 bucket.
Within the Django app settings python file enter the name and region name for the AWS s3 bucket that you have set up as indicated below:  
![AWS bucket - aws Django settings](assets/readme/django_settings_aws.png)

Within Heroku add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to the config variables and also add a USE_AWS key and set it to true.  The access key and secret key are contained with the **downloaded csv file**.

Once that is done, git add, commit and push the changes which will trigger a deployment to Heroku.  Check the Heroku build log to check that the static files were collected and there should be a 'static' folder within the s3 bucket. 

## Add media files to s3 bucket
The below instructions detail how to do this within the s3 management interface.

* Within the s3 bucket overview click create folder and call it media.
* Inside that folder click on âuploadâ and then âadd filesâ
* Select all of the product images (found within the repo download performed earlier) and click open
* Click next and then under permissions, check the box for âgrant public-read accessâ:  
![AWS bucket - add media](assets/readme/aws_bucket_add_media.png)
* Then click upload.
* There should now be a 'media' folder within the s3 bucket containing the images. 

# Stripe Setup
* Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account or log in to existing.
* On the Stripe dashboard, under âDevelopersâ copy the âtest API keyâ and â Secret keyâ.  Use these as the values for the environment and Heroku variables STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as detailed above. 

## Create new webhook end point.
**NOTE:** Two separate webhooks will need to be setup. One for the development environment and one for the Heroku app.
* Run the application to get the address of the site.  Copy this and go to the Stripe dashboard.
* Click âDevelopersâ, select âwebhooksâ and then click âAdd endpointâ.
* Paste in the site URL and add to the end â/checkout/wh/â:  
![Stripe webhook url entry](assets/readme/stripe_wh_url.png)
* Click âSelect Eventsâ and select the events to listen to as:
```
  âpayment_intent_suceededâ 

  âpayment_intent_failedâ
```
* In the newly created webhook endpoint details the âsigning secretâ is now available.  Copy this and add it to the value for the environment and Heroku variable STRIPE_WH_SECRET as detailed above.
* Within the Stripe dashboard for that webhook, click âsend test webhookâ and verify that it is working.

The STRIPE_CURRENCY variable is defined within the Django app 'settings' python file and is set to âgbpâ.  If a different currency is needed then this will need to be changed.  See this link for [supported currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#presentment-currencies)

# Email Setup
The below instructions cover the setup using a [Gmail](https://google.com) account.

* Log in to your email account or set one up.
* Click account settings, and select the 'Accounts and Import' option from the top selection
* Under âChange account settingsâ click âOther Google Account settingsâ
* Click on the âsecurityâ option on the left and then under âSigning in to Googleâ click on â2-Step Verificationâ
* Click âget startedâ, enter password and then work through the verification.
* Once verification is done and 2-Step verification is turned on, a new option now shows under the previous âSigning in to Googleâ menu screen.
* In this, on the App passwords screen, select from the dropdowns; âmailâ for app and âotherâ for device.  Add an appropriate name and click âgenerateâ.
You will then be given a 16 character password which you will need to copy.

## In Heroku.
Within the Heroku Config variables add the 16 character password as the value to the variable âEMAIL_HOST_PASSâ.  Add another variable called âEMAIL_HOST_USERâ and set the value as the gmail account email used.
